Download and use .exe! 

Requirements: Pynput and six

Made with Pynput and executable converted with PyInstaller, code is in the .pyw file. 

Usecase: For now just for fun and maybe getting some of my teacher's accounts. 

Concept: It is all functional programming: create listener, listen for keys, log the keys in an arr, save them in cache, then write to file, It all runs in the background due to Pyinstaller and Pyinput saved me about 500 lines of code to listen for all the keys but after all DNRY is my motto! I removed the AWS writing ability as it would not work on different OSs and distributions of Windows so I will just stick to logging in the download area, perhaps will use something else rather than Boto3S3 in the future!
